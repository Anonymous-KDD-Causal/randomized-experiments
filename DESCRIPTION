Description: Implementation of HCM-ReR (Hierarchical Clustering Matched Re-Randomization) 
    and PWD-ReR (Principal component Weighted Distance Re-Randomization) methods for 
    generating balanced treatment allocations in randomized experiments. These methods 
    improve covariate balance while maintaining the randomization principle.
